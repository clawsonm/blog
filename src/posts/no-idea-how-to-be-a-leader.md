### Summary

Some of my experiences and thoughts on my first few months of being the leader of a development team.

## Back story

I was the junior dev and content to be so.  My manager pushed me to take on new projects and take ownership of them which I did. This was good for me. I learned a lot. We hired a couple junior devs and I was assigned to mentor one of them. Then my manager found better employment somewhere else, and so did the senior front end developer who was mentoring the other junior dev. Our QA tester also went on maternity leave around the same time.

Our team was cut in half. All of a sudden I found myself the senior developer on a team of junior devs. The team flailed around for a bit and I started taking over my former manager's responsibilities. Then I was asked formally to be the team lead, and asked to help the team become more agile and transition to a flat management structure. To protect my team, the stories that include them will only have positive outcomes.

## Initial problems

Taking over mentoring the junior front end developer was something I knew I was not capable of. Before the senior front end developer left I asked him how he got to where he was, what resources he used, etc. He recommended [HTML5 Weekly](http://html5weekly.com/), [CSS weekly](http://css-weekly.com/), [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/), [Node Weekly](http://nodeweekly.com/), and [Responsive Design Weekly](http://responsivedesignweekly.com/), and to follow a lot of front end devs on Twitter. I did so. I began reading 15-20 articles a day from the above sources. My knowledge increased, I felt, exponentially for a couple months. My teammate also did many of the same things (though at a reduced volume) and grew a lot as a front end developer. And it's amazing seeing that happen real time. We can now talk to each other as equals, and yet still come to each other for help and advice. We are now exploring together, no longer as mentor and mentee, but united in a pursuit of excellence.

My former manager was pretty good at keeping the whole team busy, assigning tasks, and balancing projects, but he put a lot of that burden on himself (except for the projects he asked me to take ownership of). So when he left, the junior back end developer and I were in the habit of waiting for tasks to be assigned us. For me that bad habit was project dependent, e.g. some projects I mentally had ownership of and kept on top of habitually, and others not. As I flailed around trying to take over all the essential things my manager did, I neglected my teammate. For a while, I thought he either hated me or hated work in general because he never had tasks assigned to him to work on.

The most effective thing we did to improve the situation we stumbled on kind of accidentally. With our former manager, all new tickets were assigned to him so that he would be aware of them as soon as they were entered. Our Jira admin changed the default assignee to Unassigned and for a month or so we had trouble keeping up on them. I tried to get into the habit of checking the backlog, but I was still drowning in all the things I was responsible for, so I asked my teammate to help me out and keep up on the back log. Within a month better communication had been habitualized, and we are much more effective at assigning tasks to ourselves or passing them off to each other, etc. This time I'm not sure what happened to change things but I believe this helped.

## My problems

Our team went to [Agile Roots 2015](http://www.agileroots.com/) in near by Salt Lake City. I learned a lot, not only how to be more effective, but also to diagnose our problems. One such problem was me. Since I was balancing all our projects, I found myself switching between them a lot. I became almost incapable of spending dedicated time in any one of them. I incorrectly saw my role as cleaning up the little things so my team could work more effectively on their projects, protecting them from the mess as it were, and not delegating. The problem with this is that instead of our team being cut in half it was essentially cut by 1/3 and we were able to do exponentially less work than we were before.

To work on this, I started to prioritize projects and tell myself that I would work on that project exclusively until it was done and I could move on. The reality was that I would procrastinate working on the larger tasks by working on the smaller tickets/bugs thinking that I'd get all the small stuff out of the way first and then work on the big stuff. When I did work on the big projects and when I would, inevitably, get interrupted, the cycle of procrastination would then start over again. I am getting better, but I'm impatient and feel bad whenever I find myself perpetuating the cycle.

Don't get me wrong, I work hard; I'm just learning how to manage priorities. I've had a really hard time giving up the idea of having large blocks of time to work on something. I really want to be left alone sometimes. Often, I feel like I'm being interrupted too much to ever learn new things or new ways of thinking, or to get through the tasks I need to do. The skill of returning to work full throttle after each and every interruption is one I'm still learning.

More recently, I'm finding a more sinister problem with my ineffectiveness: my knowledge has been increasing because of all the things I read, but that has just been knowledge; my experience lags behind. To help with this, I've done a lot of the workshoppers on [nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list). I've written this blog as an experiment with static site generators. I've tried to work more on other personal projects. I have a tendency to come home after a long day at work and just play video games or hang out with friends and forget about work. I'm getting better at balancing personal improvement and relaxation, otherwise this blog would still be a myth. But I'm also working on pushing my limits of experience at work as well. And it is scary, as the problems I'm facing are not simple algorithmic ones but architectural ones requiring different ways of thinking.

## What I am learning about being a leader

First and foremost to me being a leader is about being human and realizing that other people are human too. Being human to me means that I have emotions, and needs both personal and professional, and I make mistakes all the time, and my motivations are never perfect. The same applies to those I lead. They have complex emotional needs/desires both personal and professional. The reasons they do the things they do or say the things they say I may never understand, but I can respect them. Respect leads to trust and trust leads to honesty and vulnerability. Vulnerability leads to improvement. The willingness to make mistakes and admit them or admit that you are wrong is one of the first steps to real learning. Being human means that we are all imperfect and trying to be better, happier people, each with our own way of going about it and that's okay. An important point for me to realize is that this means I have to be okay with uncertainty, with taking responsibility for things I don't have control of, eg. the actions of other people, while not neglecting what I do have control of. It also means I need to be be humble and ask for help and advice.

And second, for developers especially on agile teams, being a leader is about being a good developer, including things like fostering communication, admitting strengths and weaknesses, taking advantage of my strengths and my teammates' strengths, helping each other to excel, trying myself to excel and continually improve, and being focused and dedicated to the task at hand.

## Conclusion

 I definitely still feel like I'm flailing around, like I'm drowning a lot of the time. Part of that feeling is because of the fast moving technology world we live in, especially the fast pace of front end technologies. Part of it is because I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm just figuring it out. I'm grateful for all the people who are helping me along. But the fact still remains: I have no idea how to be a leader. And it's okay.
